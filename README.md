Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with a sliding or rolling window approach is a technique employed in time series forecasting where the model is trained on sequential segments of the data. This allows the model to learn patterns within each window and make predictions for the next steps.

The steps to implement LSTM with a sliding or rolling window approach for time series forecasting are as follows:
1. Data Preparation:

    Window Size: Determine the size of the window, which represents the number of past time steps the model will consider to make predictions.
    Sequence Generation: Create sequences of data by sliding the window along the time series. Each sequence consists of input features (lagged values) and the corresponding target (future values to predict).

2. Model Architecture:

    Define the LSTM Model: Set up the LSTM architecture with appropriate input shape, number of LSTM layers, neurons, activation functions, and output layer.
    Compile the Model: Define the loss function and optimizer for training the model.

3. Training:

    Sliding Window Training: Train the LSTM model on the generated sequences. Iterate through each window of data and update the model weights.
    Update Model State: For each new window, initialize the LSTM cell state using the final cell state of the previous window to capture long-term dependencies.

4. Prediction:

    Forecasting: Use the trained model to predict future values by iteratively feeding new input sequences and obtaining predictions for the next steps.
    Updating Window: Slide the window forward by one step and repeat the prediction process for the subsequent steps.
