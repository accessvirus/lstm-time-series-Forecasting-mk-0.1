improvements you might consider for the time series forecasting with LSTM:

    Data Preprocessing: Ensure proper handling of missing values, outlier detection, and appropriate normalization or scaling methods based on your data distribution.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different window sizes, batch sizes, learning rates, and LSTM architecture parameters (such as hidden units or layers) to optimize model performance.

    Model Architecture: Explore variations in the LSTM architecture, including stacked or bidirectional LSTMs, different activation functions, dropout layers for regularization, or incorporating other layers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or attention mechanisms for enhanced performance.

    Loss Function: Besides Mean Squared Error (MSE), consider other loss functions that might better suit your problem, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or custom loss functions tailored to your specific objectives.

    Validation and Testing: Implement a separate validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and a test set for final evaluation to avoid overfitting and to assess generalization capabilities.

    Learning Rate Scheduling: Experiment with learning rate schedules (e.g., decay or step-wise) to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training for faster convergence and better performance.

    Regularization: Incorporate regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization or dropout layers to prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with complex models.

    Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques by combining predictions from multiple LSTM models or different architectures to improve forecasting accuracy.

    Early Stopping: Implement early stopping based on validation loss to prevent the model from overfitting and save computation time.

    Feature Engineering: Consider incorporating external features or engineered features that might improve the model's predictive power.

By iteratively trying out these improvements and carefully monitoring their impact on the model's performance, you can enhance the accuracy and robustness of your LSTM-based time series forecasting model.
